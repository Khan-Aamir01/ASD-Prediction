# Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Detection is a web-based application that helps assess the likelihood of ASD in individuals based on a series of questions. The project integrates a **Machine Learning model** to analyze user responses and provide an assessment.

This tool aims to provide **early screening** to help parents, caregivers, and individuals identify potential signs of ASD.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
### ðŸ’» **Frontend**
- React.js (Vite)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling)
- React Router (for navigation)

### ðŸ§  **Backend & Machine Learning**
- Python (Flask or FastAPI for API)
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (for ML Model)
- OpenCV (if image processing is involved)
- Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)

### ðŸ—„ **Database**
- MongoDB / PostgreSQL (if needed for storing responses)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… 15-20 Questionnaire for ASD prediction
âœ… Machine Learning Model Integration for prediction
âœ… User-Friendly Interface with React & Tailwind
âœ… Real-time Analysis and response-based assessment
âœ… Responsive UI for Mobile & Desktop

ðŸŽ¯ How It Works
1. User answers a set of 15-20 questions.
2. The responses are sent to the ML model via an API.
3. The ML model processes the inputs and predicts whether the user may have ASD.
4. The result is displayed on the UI with suggestions for further action.
